> **The Adaptive Brain for Versatile Thermostat**

A Home Assistant integration that learns your heating system and automatically starts heating at exactly the right time—no manual tuning required.

---

## What IHP Does

```
📅 Next heating: 18:00 (target 21°C)
🧠 Learned slope: 2.3°C/hour
⏰ Start time: 16:42 (calculated automatically)
✅ Room reaches 21°C exactly at 18:00
```

IHP monitors your VTherm, learns how fast your room heats, and triggers your scheduler at the perfect moment so you arrive to a warm home—every time.

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1. Install via HACS

```
HACS → Integrations → ⋮ → Custom repositories
→ Add: https://github.com/RastaChaum/Intelligent-Heating-Pilot
→ Search "Intelligent Heating Pilot" → Download → Restart HA
```

**[Full installation guide →](docs/INSTALLATION.md)**

### 2. Configure

```
Settings → Devices & Services → + Add Integration
→ Search "Intelligent Heating Pilot"
→ Select VTherm + Scheduler → Submit
```

**[Full configuration guide →](docs/CONFIGURATION.md)**

### 3. Let It Learn

- First 5 cycles: conservative (starts early)
- After 20+ cycles: very accurate predictions
- No manual intervention needed

## 💡 Key Concepts

**Learned Heating Slope** - How fast your room heats (°C/hour)
- Calculated from detected heating cycles (start temp → end temp)
- Refined over time with trimmed mean algorithm
- Used to predict exact start time for next event

**Example:** To heat 3°C at 2°C/hour → Start 90 minutes early ✅

**Vacation Mode** - No action needed!
- IHP automatically stops when scheduler disabled
- Re-enables when you turn scheduler back on
- Preserves learned data across vacation periods
